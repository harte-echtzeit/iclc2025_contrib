In this package, you can find the instructions and submission templates for proposals in the following presentation categories:

* Papers (short or long)
* Live Performances (various options)
* Workshops (short or long)

## Instructions

The working templates for each category are available in two formats: in *Markdown* (also known as *Commonmark*) format, and OpenDocument.

* **Independent of which template you choose to work with, please make sure you submit your contribution as a PDF file!**
* PDF files must be included in the submission in EasyChair. Please read instructions on the submission page to make sure your attachment is received. 

Please see below for template instructions specific to each presentation category.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via [iclc@toplap.cat](mailto:iclc@toplap.cat).

### Markdown / Commonmark Templates

With the Markdown template, you write your paper as a text file, with simple markup to specify formatting, citations and the inclusion of images. This file (README.md) is itself formatted in the *Markdown* format. 

To convert Markdown files to PDF You need [**Pandoc**](http://pandoc.org) and a LaTeX distribution installed.

**Note: The `papers` template has been updated to work with very recent versions of Pandoc. It has been successfully tested with versions 3.1.8 and 3.3. If you still run into issues, please contact us via [iclc@toplap.cat](mailto:iclc@toplap.cat).**

In addition:

 - *Papers template*: for more information please refer to the template itself. Because the template is a bit more complex, we have included a tutorial on how to convert the Markdown file to PDF. 
 - *Other templates*: to convert basic Markdown files to PDF, run the following command:
 
```
pandoc your_proposal.md -o your_proposal.pdf
```

### Open Document Templates

This template comes in the form of an OpenDocument document, where you replace the example text with that of your paper. Please follow examples for sections, figures, and citations.

These templates should work for LibreOffice, Google Docs and Microsoft Word.
