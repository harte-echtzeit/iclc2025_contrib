# ICLC 2025 - Proposal for Live Performances

Live Performances (including audio, visual, and A/V or multimedia)
will largely be sorted into one of two formats: a concert format, with
seated audience; and an Algorave format, unseated and intended for
dancing. As we explore venues and dates, and according to patterns
that we see emerge from the submissions received, we intend to program
several different subcategories of the concert format.

## 1. General Information

- **Performance Title:**
	audience first - petri-nets for audience-driven live coding
- **Main Contact:**
Christopher Taudt (harte echtzeit), info@harte-echtzeit.com
- **Additional Performers:**
none
- **Performance Type:** (Algorave, Concert, \...)
concert

## 2. Abstract

Unlike in an ordinary live coding performance, this piece will be performed by the audience and the artist together. By applying the approach of a petri-nets-based notation/meta-language system for live coding (see my paper submission), the audience will have the opportunity to use a set of inputs to interactively change the course of the prepared code for the performance. The inputs will be used to change patterns, rhythms as well as parameters of code on-the-fly. It's an experiment to explore how the audience can live code alongside the artist.

## 3. Video and/or Audio Material

Please find some of my performances here: XXX

The submitted performance will be similar in style but will utilize petri nets as a structuring method which will enable audience interaction from MIDI-interfaces. Please refer also to the submitted paper.

## 5. Artist(s) Biography

harte echtzeit (HE) is a scientist whos mind is bend in a strange sort of emotional way which allows for inspiration to flow. he is working with algorithms, data, live coding and music since 2022. a series of gravitational wave field recordings is HEs first album-length performance. he is loosely related to German live coding hubs such as LOL2 in Leipzig as well as Toplap Düsseldorf and organizes algoraves, workshops and other events himself. I have released my first album on Call It Aything Records as *ji kū kan* in 2024..
