# ICLC 2025 - Proposal for Live Performances

Live Performances (including audio, visual, and A/V or multimedia)
will largely be sorted into one of two formats: a concert format, with
seated audience; and an Algorave format, unseated and intended for
dancing. As we explore venues and dates, and according to patterns
that we see emerge from the submissions received, we intend to program
several different subcategories of the concert format.

## 1. General Information

- **Performance Title:**
	audience first - petri-nets for audience-driven live coding
- **Main Contact:**

- **Additional Performers:**

- **Performance Type:** (Algorave, Concert, \...)

## 2. Abstract

Unlike in an ordinary live coding performance, this piece will be performed by the audience and the artist together. By applying the approach of a petri-nets-based notation/meta-language system for live coding (see my paper submission), the audience will have the opportunity to use a set of inputs to interactively change the course of the prepared code for the performance. The inputs will be used to change patterns, rhythms as well as parameters of code on-the-fly. It's an experiment to explore how the audience can live code alongside the artist.

## 3. Video and/or Audio Material

Please find some of my performances here:

The submitted performance will be similar in style but will utilize petri nets as a structuring method which will enable audience interaction from MIDI-interfaces. Please refer also to the submitted paper.

## 4. Program Note

Unlike in an ordinary live coding performance, this piece will be performed by the audience and the artist together. By applying the approach of a petri-nets-based notation/meta-language system for live coding (see my paper submission), the audience will have the opportunity to use a set of inputs to interactively change the course of the prepared code for the performance. The inputs will be used to change patterns, rhythms as well as parameters of code on-the-fly. It's an experiment to explore how the audience can live code alongside the artist.

## 5. Artist(s) Biography

Please provide a short biography (max. 150 words each) for each
performer involved in this performance. These will be published in the
proceedings of the Conference.

**PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO FILL OUT THE TECHNICAL QUESTIONNAIRE BELOW!**

# ICLC 2025 – Technical Requirements

Live Performances

## 1. General Information

### 1.1 What setting is the performance intended for?

Please describe the ideal conditions, e.g. Algorave with dancing
audience, concert setting with seated audience, setting with
moving/exploring audience? Inside, outside, lighting preferences?
Please indicate if any conditions are simply nice-to-have or absolute
showstoppers.

### 1.2 How many performers will be in the performance?

### 1.3 Are you open to being paired with another performer?

If you’re submitting a visual-only or music-only Algorave performance,
the Committee may select a complimentary performer to create a
combined A/V set, without additional input from you. You may answer
“no” if you don't want to be paired in this way.

### 1.4 Will your performance require technical support during the set?

Is support needed, e.g. to run lighting changes, timings, etc.? If
yes, please describe.

## 2. Materials Needed

### VIDEO

### 2.1 What are your projection needs?

Please state what connector type(s) you need (HDMI, VGA, ...), and the
ideal or minimum resolution. Do you need one or more extra
projections, in addition to the main screen?

### AUDIO

### 2.2 How many input channels on the mixing console do you need?

Please also mention your preferred type(s) of input (XLR, ¼", etc.).

### 2.3 Do you require a microphone? If so, how many microphones does your performance need?

### 2.4 Do you require a monitor, either over headphones or otherwise?

### 2.5 Are you bringing your own audio interface?

If you can’t bring your own for any reason, please state what you need
or what you think would be compatible.

### OTHER

### 2.6 How much table/floor space will you need for your performance? How many chairs?

### 2.7 Do you need an internet connection during the performance?

Please state if you need Wi-Fi, if you could use Ethernet, and how the
performance relies upon a remote connection of any kind.

### 2.8 Anything else you need?

Cables, adapters, power strips, anything else you can't bring yourself?
